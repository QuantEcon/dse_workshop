Summer School](https://dseconf.org/) to be held at ANU in December 2022.

Instructor:

* John Stachurski ([Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), Co-founder of [QuantEcon](https://dseconf.org/))

Topics:

The talk will cover theory and applications of dynamic programming.

All of the material is based on the forthcoming textbook [Dynamic
Programming](https://github.com/QuantEcon/book-dp1/) by Thomas J. Sargent and
John Stachurski

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuantEcon/book-dp1/) contains 

* the latest version of the text (dp.pdf) 
* the lecture slides (see `slides`)
* and the source code (Python and Julia)

This repo also contains related DP code --- see `code` directory

The GPU-based code is designed to run smoothly on Google colab
