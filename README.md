![](qe-logo-large.png)

This is the homepage for an extended talk on dynamic programming at the [DSE
Summer School](https://dseconf.org/) to be held at ANU in December 2022.

## Instructor

* John Stachurski 

## Topics

The talk will cover theory and applications of dynamic programming.

All of the material is based on the forthcoming textbook [Dynamic
Programming](https://github.com/QuantEcon/book-dp1/) by Thomas J. Sargent and
John Stachurski.

### Agenda

1. Quick intro via job search
2. Review of MDPs
2. MDP algorithms
2. Refactoring dynamic programs
2. Implementing DP in Python (Numba, JAX, GPUs)

## Resources

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuantEcon/book-dp1/) contains 

* the latest version of the text (dp.pdf) 
* the lecture slides (see `slides`)
* and the source code (Python and Julia)

This repo also contains related DP code --- see `code` directory

The GPU-based code is designed to run smoothly on Google colab
